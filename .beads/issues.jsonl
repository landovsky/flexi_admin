It requires explicit configuration through:\n- nodePaths option in JavaScript config\n- alias option in JavaScript config\n- Or a custom plugin\n\n### Implemented Solution: esbuild.config.mjs with alias\nCreated a JavaScript config file that uses esbuild's native alias feature:\n```javascript\nalias: {\n  'flexi_admin': path.resolve(__dirname, '../../lib/flexi_admin/javascript/flexi_admin.js')\n}\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Works reliably across all environments\n- More explicit and maintainable\n- Follows esbuild best practices\n- Easier to debug module resolution issues\n\n### @hotwired/stimulus-loading Not Used\nThe plan included stimulus-loading for automatic controller discovery. This package provides:\n- eagerLoadControllersFrom()\n- lazyLoadControllersFrom()\n\n**Why we didn't use it:**\n- Not in package.json dependencies\n- Adds unnecessary complexity for just one controller\n- Manual registration is clearer and more explicit\n\n**Implemented Instead:**\nManual import and registration in controllers/index.js:\n```javascript\nimport EditController from \"./edit_controller\"\napplication.register(\"edit\", EditController)\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Simpler, no additional dependencies\n- More explicit about what's being loaded\n- Easier to debug\n- Better tree-shaking\n\n## Success Criteria Met\n\n✅ npm install completes without errors\n✅ npm run build creates app/assets/builds/application.js and .js.map\n✅ Build output shows 'flexi_admin' module was resolved from gem\n✅ No \"Module not found\" errors\n✅ Bundle includes both dummy and gem controllers\n✅ Bundle size is reasonable (382KB)\n\n## Next Steps\n\nThe JavaScript integration is complete and verified.

The gem currently has minimal testing (only 2 spec files), and this implementation will create a robust test foundation with RSpec documentation output for human-readable test coverage reports.\n\n## Key Infrastructure Requirements\n\nThe flexi_admin gem is a Rails Engine (isolated namespace) with:\n- 51 ViewComponents with Slim templates\n- 17 Stimulus JavaScript controllers  \n- Controller concerns (ResourcesController, ModalsController)\n- Pure Ruby models (Struct, ContextParams, Toast, Context)\n- Service objects (CreateResource, UpdateResource)\n- Dependencies: Rails 7.1+, ViewComponent 3.20, will_paginate, slim-rails\n\n**Critical requirement:** Must create a dummy Rails application within spec/ to test Rails-dependent components and integration scenarios.\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n\n### Phase 1: Test Infrastructure Setup\n\n- [ ] **flexi_admin.gemspec** - Add test dependencies:\n  - `capybara` (~\u003e 3.39) for integration testing\n  - `selenium-webdriver` (~\u003e 4.15) for browser automation\n  - `webdrivers` (~\u003e 5.3) for driver management\n  - `factory_bot_rails` (~\u003e 6.4) for test data\n  - `database_cleaner-active_record` (~\u003e 2.1) for test isolation\n  - `rspec-rails` (already present, verify version ~\u003e 6.1)\n  - Keep as development dependencies\n\n- [ ] **spec/rails_helper.rb** - New Rails test environment bootstrap:\n  - Load dummy Rails app from spec/dummy/config/environment\n  - Require rspec/rails and support files\n  - Include ViewComponent::TestHelpers and Capybara::DSL\n  - Configure DatabaseCleaner with transaction strategy\n  - Set up FactoryBot syntax methods\n  - Configure Capybara with selenium driver\n  - Load I18n with flexi_admin locales\n  - Configure RSpec to use --format documentation (already in .rspec)\n\n- [ ] **spec/support/view_component_helpers.rb** - ViewComponent test utilities\n- [ ] **spec/support/factory_bot.rb** - FactoryBot configuration  \n- [ ] **spec/support/database_cleaner.rb** - DatabaseCleaner hooks\n\n### Phase 2: Dummy Rails Application\n\nCreate a minimal Rails 7.1 app structure under spec/dummy/:\n\n- [ ] **spec/dummy/config/application.rb** - Rails app with FlexiAdmin engine mounted\n- [ ] **spec/dummy/config/boot.rb** - Bundler setup\n- [ ] **spec/dummy/config/environment.rb** - Environment initialization  \n- [ ] **spec/dummy/config/environments/test.rb** - Test environment config\n- [ ] **spec/dummy/config/database.yml** - SQLite3 in-memory database\n- [ ] **spec/dummy/config/routes.rb** - Mount engine + define admin routes\n- [ ] **spec/dummy/config/initializers/flexi_admin.rb** - Configure namespace as :admin\n\n- [ ] **spec/dummy/app/models/application_record.rb** - Base model\n- [ ] **spec/dummy/app/models/user.rb** - Test model with ApplicationResource concern\n- [ ] **spec/dummy/app/models/comment.rb** - Child model for nested tests\n\n- [ ] **spec/dummy/app/controllers/application_controller.rb** - Base controller\n- [ ] **spec/dummy/app/controllers/admin/users_controller.rb** - Uses ResourcesController concern\n- [ ] **spec/dummy/app/controllers/admin/comments_controller.rb** - Nested resource controller\n\n- [ ] **spec/dummy/db/migrate/001_create_users.rb** - User table migration\n- [ ] **spec/dummy/db/migrate/002_create_comments.rb** - Comment table migration  \n- [ ] **spec/dummy/db/schema.rb** - Schema definition\n\n- [ ] **spec/factories/users.rb** - User factory\n- [ ] **spec/factories/comments.rb** - Comment factory\n\n### Phase 3: Integration Tests (UI Test Cases)\n\nMap ui-test-cases.md scenarios to RSpec integration tests:\n\n- [ ] **spec/integration/users_list_spec.rb** - Users List Page (UL-001 to UL-020):\n  - Search \u0026 Filter scenarios (UL-001 to UL-005)\n  - Sorting scenarios (UL-006 to UL-009)  \n  - Selection \u0026 Bulk Actions (UL-010 to UL-014)\n  - Pagination \u0026 Layout (UL-015 to UL-020)\n\n- [ ] **spec/integration/user_detail_spec.rb** - User Detail Page (UD-001 to UD-009):\n  - Navigation \u0026 Layout (UD-001 to UD-002)\n  - Data Display \u0026 Interaction (UD-003 to UD-006)\n  - Actions (UD-007 to UD-009)\n\n### Phase 4: ViewComponent Tests\n\nStart with components used in UI test cases:\n\n- [ ] **spec/components/resources/index_page_component_spec.rb** - Main index page wrapper\n- [ ] **spec/components/resources/resources_component_spec.rb** - Resources listing container\n- [ ] **spec/components/resources/list_view/table_component_spec.rb** - Table view\n- [ ] **spec/components/resources/pagination_component_spec.rb** -

Link rendering\n- [ ] **spec/components/nav/breadcrumbs_component_spec.rb** - Breadcrumb navigation\n\n### Phase 5: Controller Tests\n\n- [ ] **spec/requests/resources_controller_spec.rb** - Test ResourcesController concern:\n  - CRUD actions (index, show, create, update, destroy)\n  - Context params handling\n  - Parent/child relationships via GlobalID\n  - Turbo Stream responses\n  - Bulk action processing\n\n### Phase 6: JavaScript Tests\n\n- [ ] **package.json** - Update with test dependencies:\n  - `jest` (~\u003e 29.7)\n  - `@testing-library/dom` (~\u003e 9.3)\n  - `jsdom` (~\u003e 23.0)\n  - Add test script: `\"test\": \"jest\"`\n\n- [ ] **jest.config.js** - Jest configuration for Stimulus testing\n\n- [ ] **spec/javascript/controllers/bulk_action_controller.test.js** - Priority test:\n  - sessionStorage persistence (per lessons-learned.md)\n  - Selection toggling\n  - Cross-pagination state\n  - UI updates (counter, selection text)\n\n- [ ] **spec/javascript/controllers/pagination_controller.test.js**\n- [ ] **spec/javascript/controllers/sorting_controller.test.js**\n- [ ] **spec/javascript/controllers/filter_auto_submit_controller.test.js**\n\n### Phase 7: Documentation Output\n\n- [ ] **.rspec** - Already configured with `--format documentation`\n- [ ] **README.md** - Add testing section with:\n  - Running tests: `bundle exec rspec`\n  - Generate documentation: `bundle exec rspec --format documentation --out spec_docs.txt`\n  - JavaScript tests: `npm test`\n  - Running specific test types\n\n- [ ] **spec/spec_documentation_generator.rake** - Rake task to generate human-readable test docs\n\n## Watch Out For\n\n### Rails Engine Testing Complexity\n- **Risk:** Engine testing requires mounting in a host Rails app, which is more complex than standard Rails testing\n- **How to avoid:** The dummy app pattern is the standard approach used by other engine gems (Devise, Kaminari). Follow spec/dummy structure carefully. The dummy app must properly configure FlexiAdmin::Config.configuration.namespace.\n\n### ViewComponent Rendering Dependencies  \n- **Risk:** Components depend on Rails helpers (main_app, polymorphic_path) and ContextParams objects\n- **How to avoid:** Always load rails_helper for component tests, not spec_helper. Create test helper methods in spec/support/view_component_helpers.rb to build valid ContextParams instances. Reference pattern from lib/flexi_admin/components/resources/pagination_component.rb (lines 47-61) showing how components use context.params.\n\n### GlobalID Configuration for Test Models\n- **Risk:** Parent/child relationships use GlobalID for serialization, but test models won't be registered by default\n- **How to avoid:** Test models MUST include FlexiAdmin::Concerns::ApplicationResource. The dummy app initializer must ensure GlobalID is configured. See lib/flexi_admin/controllers/resources_controller.rb lines 276-296 for locate_resource implementation that depends on GlobalID::Locator.\n\n### Stimulus Controller Event Listener Cleanup\n- **Risk:** Document-level event listeners in Stimulus controllers can leak between tests if not properly removed\n- **How to avoid:** From lessons-learned.md: Always bind event handlers in connect() and store reference for proper cleanup in disconnect(). Example in lib/flexi_admin/javascript/controllers/bulk_action_controller.js lines 15-17, 24-25. Mock sessionStorage in JavaScript tests.\n\n### Scope Identifier Consistency\n- **Risk:** Different components may use different identifiers for the same resource (singular vs plural)\n- **How to avoid:** From lessons-learned.md: Always use context.scope (plural) for bulk actions, not resource.class.name.downcase (singular). This bug caused grid view vs list view selection persistence issues.\n\n### Turbo Frame Integration\n- **Risk:** Many components render turbo_stream responses that require proper Turbo setup in tests\n- **How to avoid:** Capybara must be configured with a JavaScript driver (selenium). Request specs must test both HTML and turbo_stream formats. See lib/flexi_admin/controllers/resources_controller.rb lines 36-53 for render_index dual format pattern.\n\n### I18n Configuration\n- **Risk:** Components use Czech locales (e.g., \"Zrušit\", \"Celé jméno\") from config/locales/\n- **How to avoid:** rails_helper must load FlexiAdmin engine's locale files. The dummy app's config/application.rb must configure I18n properly. Tests should use I18n.t() with flexi_admin scope.\n\n## Dependencies and Integration Points\n\n### Component Pattern to Follow\nLook at lib/flexi_admin/components/resources/pagination_component.rb:\n- Uses BaseComponent as parent (line 4)\n- Includes ResourceHelper and UrlHelper (lines 7-8)  \n- Accepts context with resources, parent, params (lines 12-19)\n- Uses context.params.merge() for building paths (lines 48-50, 56-58)\n- This pattern appears across all resource components\n\n### Controller Concern Pattern\nLook at lib/flexi_admin/controllers/resources_controller.rb:\n- Included as concern (line 4: extend ActiveSupport::Concern)\n- Uses before_action for context_params (line 10)\n- Methods like render_index respond to both format.html and format.turbo_stream (lines 40-52)\n- Uses namespaced_class helper to find components dynamically (lines 41, 47)\n- Bulk actions parse JSON ids from params (line 219)\n\n### JavaScript Controller Pattern  \nLook at lib/flexi_admin/javascript/controllers/bulk_action_controller.js:\n- Extends Stimulus Controller (line 5)\n- Defines static values and targets (lines 6-11)\n- Uses sessionStorage with scoped keys (lines 211-213)\n- Binds event listeners with stored references (lines 15-17, 24-25)\n- Updates UI conditionally with hasXxxTarget checks (lines 256-269)\n\n## Testing Approach\n\n### Integration Tests Strategy\nFor ui-test-cases.md scenarios:\n- Use Capybara feature specs with JavaScript driver\n- Create realistic data with FactoryBot (10-50 users for pagination)\n- Test actual user workflows (search → sort → select → bulk action)\n- Verify UI state changes (counter updates, selection persistence)\n- Test across page navigation (pagination retains selections per lessons-learned.md)\n\n### ViewComponent Tests Strategy  \n- Use render_inline() from ViewComponent::TestHelpers\n- Test rendered HTML with Capybara matchers (have_css, have_text)\n- For components with slots, test with block syntax\n- Mock ContextParams with minimal valid data\n- Test edge cases (nil values, empty collections, no permissions)\n\n### Controller Tests Strategy\n- Use request specs (not controller specs - Rails 7+ best practice)\n- Test via dummy app routes (e.g., /admin/users)\n- Verify both HTML and Turbo Stream responses\n- Test authorization paths (if CanCan defined)\n- Test GlobalID parent propagation for nested resources\n\n### JavaScript Tests Strategy\n- Use Jest with jsdom environment\n- Mock sessionStorage/localStorage\n- Test Stimulus lifecycle (connect, disconnect)  \n- Test action handlers triggered by events\n- Verify DOM updates and data attribute changes\n- For bulk_action_controller: Test persistence patterns from lessons-learned.md\n\n## RSpec Documentation Output\n\nThe .rspec file already has `--format documentation` configured. To generate human-readable output:\n\n```bash\n# Run all tests with documentation output\nbundle exec rspec --format documentation\n\n# Save to file for review\nbundle exec rspec --format documentation --out spec_documentation.txt\n\n# Generate HTML report (requires rspec_html_formatter gem)\nbundle exec rspec --format html --out spec_report.html\n```\n\nConsider adding SimpleCov for coverage reporting in spec/rails_helper.rb:\n```ruby\nrequire 'simplecov'\nSimpleCov.start 'rails' do\n  add_filter '/spec/'\n  add_filter '/config/'\nend\n```\n\n## Implementation Order\n\n1. **Phase 1 + Phase 2** (Infrastructure + Dummy App) - Must complete together, can't test anything without this\n2. **Phase 3** (Integration Tests) - Highest priority per requirements, implements ui-test-cases.md\n3. **Phase 4** (ViewComponent Tests) - Run in parallel with Phase 3 after infrastructure is ready\n4. **Phase 5** (Controller Tests) - After components are tested\n5. **Phase 6** (JavaScript Tests) - Can run in parallel after Phase 1, independent of Ruby tests\n6. **Phase 7** (Documentation) - Final touches after tests are passing\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] All UI test cases from artifacts/ui-test-cases.md are covered (UL-001 through UL-020, UD-001 through UD-009)\n- [ ] Integration tests run with Capybara + Selenium and pass\n- [ ] ViewComponent tests cover main components used in UI flows\n- [ ] Controller tests verify CRUD operations and Turbo Stream responses\n- [ ] JavaScript tests cover bulk_action_controller with sessionStorage persistence\n- [ ] `bundle exec rspec` runs successfully and generates documentation output\n- [ ] README includes clear testing instructions\n- [ ] Tests run successfully in fresh checkout (db migrations, asset compilation)\n\n## Lessons from Past Work\n\nFrom .claude/lessons-learned.md:\n- Always bind and store document-level event listeners for proper cleanup\n- Use sessionStorage for Turbo frame state persistence pattern\n- Ensure scope identifiers are consistent (use context.scope, not resource.class.name)\n- Check for optional targets with hasXxxTarget before manipulating UI elements","created_at":"2026-02-02T15:48:32.55765603Z"}]}

This was causing 403 errors because CSRF protection was enabled in development mode.\n\n2. **Dummy app controllers not autoloading** - Added proper `config.autoload_paths` and `config.eager_load_paths` in spec/dummy/config/application.rb. The previous `config.paths['app/controllers']` approach wasn't working.\n\n3. **Missing puma server for Capybara** - Added puma ~\u003e 6.0 to gemspec development dependencies.\n\n4. **Jest ES modules not transforming** - Added babel-jest and babel.config.json for proper ES module support in JavaScript tests.\n\n5. **Database config only had 'test' environment** - Added default and development configs to database.yml to prevent load errors.\n\n6. **Controller inheritance issue** - Changed `ApplicationController` to `::ApplicationController` in namespaced controllers.\n\n7. **Component test API mismatch** - Updated view_component_helpers.rb to use correct FlexiAdmin::Models::Resources::Context and ContextParams APIs.\n\n8. **PaginationComponent constructor** - Fixed test to pass context as positional arg with per_page and page as keyword args.\n\n### Test Results Summary\n\n**Passing (24 tests):**\n- Infrastructure tests (4/4)\n- FlexiAdmin version test (1/1)\n- Struct model tests (6/6)\n- Request specs for index action (5/5: returns success, renders resources, applies search, applies sorting, paginates)\n- Request spec for invalid params error handling (1/1)\n\n**Failing (42 tests):**\n- ViewComponent tests (6) - Require full routing helpers not available in isolated component tests\n- Integration/Feature tests (27) - Require full page rendering with actual FlexiAdmin components\n- Request specs for show/create/update/destroy (9) - Require full ResourcesController concern implementation\n\n### Minor Issues (Not Fixed)\n\n1. **Integration tests need real component implementations** - The dummy controller index action returns JSON, not actual FlexiAdmin components. Full integration tests require the complete component stack.\n\n2. **ViewComponent tests need routing context** - Components like PaginationComponent use `resources_path` helper which requires mounted routes. Would need request-level component tests or route stubbing.\n\n3. **JavaScript tests need better Stimulus lifecycle** - Some tests fail because the controller's connect() method isn't being properly triggered by Jest/jsdom.\n\n4. **Deprecation warning** - `fixture_path` deprecated, should use `fixture_paths` (array).\n\n### Implementer Deviations\n\n1. **Created simple JSON-returning index action** - Appropriate for infrastructure validation but tests expecting full HTML rendering will fail.\n\n2. **Integration tests assume specific CSS selectors** - Tests reference `.user-row`, `.user-name`, `.breadcrumb` etc. which may not match actual component output.\n\n3. **UI test cases marked as \"covered\"** - TESTING.md claims 29/29 UI test cases covered, but tests are structured outlines, not working tests against real UI.\n\n### Recommendations for Full Test Coverage\n\n1. Create controller concern that fully implements CRUD actions for test resources\n2. Add view templates or configure FlexiAdmin components to render for test User model\n3. Use system tests or request specs with rendered_views for integration testing\n4. Mock route helpers in isolated component tests\n5. Set up proper Stimulus test helpers for JavaScript tests","created_at":"2026-02-02T16:12:54.727506068Z"}]}
